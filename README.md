## What is this?

BetterForge modifies the CurseForge desktop client to add a plugin system, similar to what Vencord does for Discord. Load custom plugins to add features, tweak the UI, or change how the app behaves.

## Features

- Plugin support for CurseForge
- Theme support - Apply custom CSS themes to personalize your CurseForge experience
- Live CSS Editor - Real-time CSS editor with VS Code-like syntax highlighting

## Installation

1. Download the latest release from the releases page
2. Close CurseForge completely
3. Run the installer
4. Restart CurseForge

## Installing Plugins / Themes

#### You can find example plugins in the `/plugins` folder of this repository.

- Windows: `%appdata%/BetterForge/plugins`

#### You can find example Themes in the `/themes` folder of this repository.

## FAQ

**Is this against CurseForge's terms of service?**  
Probably. Use at your own risk.

**Will this get me banned?**  
No idea. We're not responsible if it does.

No.

## Compiling from Source

To compile the project, run `bun run compile`. This will build the project and output the compiled files in the `/Packer` folder.

To compile the uninstaller, run `bun run compile_remover`. This will build the uninstaller and output as `Uninstaller.exe`.

## Contributing

Pull requests welcome. Keep code clean and document what you're doing.

## A friendly note
